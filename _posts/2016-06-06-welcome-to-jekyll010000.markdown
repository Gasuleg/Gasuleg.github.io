On week 8, I have finished to creating my API On the libring client.

I coded my client in two different parts
The right click menu where I launch my tools. To do that I need to:
    -call my API who speaks with the daemon<br>
    -send a signal connect with my second part, the goal is to display or not smartInfo (not implement yet)<br>
-The call view part where I display all my information. I passed a lot of time trying to understand some part of the code and the link between my .ui and .cpp file. I had other issues with the clutter. Now everything is display like I want, but I have some little bug in some particular case.

On week 10, I will work on the link between my two part on the client and debugging some stuff but I won't tell you everything... Keep in touch!

See you next week! :)
