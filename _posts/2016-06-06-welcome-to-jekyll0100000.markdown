Hi, <br>
This week, I worked on the gnome client. I wanted to link my right click menu with the call view. That's was difficult because the right click menu is called by a signal. So, I didn't have access to the instance of the menu to send my own signal. I tried a lot of things to implement my signal, but it's just impossible.
Then I discovered the GAction. With this technique, I just needed to change the state of my action and connect it with my method in my view and it's done!

I had now a complete working solution that I tested to find improvements and bugs.<br>
-Change the 2 buttons who launch and stop the system by one unique button.<br>
-Resolve the bug who crash ring when I tried to use SmartInfo in a new call.<br>
-Some other small bugs

See you next week!
